"We hit a bunch of memory issues which resulted in frantic ripping out and putting back in of a lot, so ended up with a good bit of stuff that barely didn't make it in. All in all really fun jam!" - [Matt McCord](https://twitter.com/mattmccordmattm) (Art, Design, Music & Related Programming)

To get it up and running, you'll need to have a emulator that can run Game Boy games. My preference is to use [BGB GameBoy Emulator](http://bgb.bircd.org/)

Once you have an emulator of choice, then:

* Download the .gb file from the [releases section](https://github.com/ASGitH/game-Boy-Action-Adventure-Template/releases/tag/build-00).
